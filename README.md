This is a repository for Node.js and AngularJS projects for [NodeJS summer project](https://github.com/TeemuKoivisto/angular-node-projekti-2016-kesa) courses

## Summary

A small MEAN (MongoDB, Express, AngularJS, Node.js) app done as part of summer Node.js and AngularJS projects. Functionality:user can see, add, edit and delete users from the database. Purpose was also to get comfortable with the JS frameworks, NoSQL databases and deploying to the cloud. Also tried out auto-deployment with nodemon (local repo only). MongoDB was hosted at mlab.com (free), App (Node.js and AngularJS) was hosted at heroku.com (free AWS instance). Works also locally.

#### Code:

Backend code: server.js

Frontend code: public/*

+ some configuration files on root

## How to run:

- Clone/fork the repo
- Make sure you have `node.js`, `git` & `npm installed`
- `npm install`
- Export MONGODB_URI that contains user, password and address to your database
- `npm start`
- Connect to `localhost:8080/` with your favourite browser
